Reading Week
============

During Reading week, you should familiarise yourself with the software tool ENVI. This is not a formal taught part of the course but 
something you should spend some time in Reading week familiarising yourself with.

There are three practicals for you to choose from. If you have never used ENVI before, you should do the first one (& others if you get time).

* `Image Display and Enhancement using ENVI <http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/geog2021/practical1/>`_
* `Spatial filtering using ENVI <http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/geog2021/practical2/>`_
* `Classification Exercise in ENVI <http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/geog2021/classificationPractical/>`_

ENVI is an image processing tool that is quite widely used in Industry and Academia. It is written in a language called IDL, which we will cover in this course. If you want to learn IDL at any point, you can find various online courses for this, such as the `one we used to run in this Department <http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/teaching/unix/>`_.
